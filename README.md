# BaSS-Rhythm-Prototype
A fully functional 4-lane rhythm game prototype where notes fall in time with the music. Features:

Random note spawning (NoteSpawner)
Note movement synced to BPM (NoteScroller)
Hit detection with Perfect, Good, and Ok zones (NoteActivator)
Scoring system based on accuracy (ScoreManager)
Miss detection and note cleanup (NoteDestroyer)
Lane button visual feedback (ButtonController)

This serves as a base for building rhythm minigames, with potential to expand with additional mechanics.
